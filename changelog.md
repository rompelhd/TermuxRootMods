# v1.0.20 Termux Root Mods - The Way It Should Be, By Rompelhd ðŸ¥µ

- Removed debug symbols from most binaries as a temporary fix for Magisk 29. sudo su was not working, so we migrated to our own binary. Applied changes to ARMHF and ARM64; x86_64 is pending but expected soon. Improvements to the termuxrootmods binary are planned to be included in the usable binaries, but not yet.
