# v1.0.9 Termux Root Mods - The Way It Should Be, By Rompelhd ðŸ¥µ

- Compiled the new cpp version of the main shell, that is to say we moved from .sh to binary.

- Now in root-home inside .config we have TermuxRootMods, where we will find config files

- Removed the extra code in updater-script

- Now is more secure the module when using Magisk overlay
